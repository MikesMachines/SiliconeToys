# SiliconeToys
A temporary place for info on making skin like silicone JO / cock sleeves, and liners for pumps and milkers. 

<p>
My notes and lessons learned on getting silicone to be as close to the feel of skin as possible. Images will be added soon. This is in no way a comprehensive guide. It's needs some serious proofreading, please let me know any feedback or questions. Much of the info is specific to mistakes I have made or watched others make. Experienced users may not find much use beyond finishing steps, but hopefully someone will find it useful :) <P>

As you can tell, color is not my strong point. There is a lot of extra powder applied, I'll try to get some more finished pics up. <P>
